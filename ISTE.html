                            rectangular ground.The rockets are then graded into 50+,60+,70+,80+,90+ according to the
                            range they cover.
                            Points are awarded as 10,20,30,40,50 respectively.The top teams will be selected for the

                            at specific ranges.The targets will be at 50 60 70 80 meters(changes might be made by
                            organizer) and points are awarded as said by organizer and a total of 120 points will be
